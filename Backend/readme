Function Expression: This is when you define a function as part of an expression, such as assigning it to a variable or a property. In your example, you're using a function expression to assign an arrow function to exports.getTransactions.
Function Declaration: This is a standalone function that is declared with the function keyword, like so:
function getTransactions(req, res, next) {
    res.send('Get Transactions');
}
exports.getTransactions = getTransactions;

Fixing the Issues
Use res.status() Instead of res.send() for Setting Status Codes:

In your addTransactions method, you're using res.send(201) which is deprecated. You should use res.status(201) and then call .json() to send the response.
Ensure Only One Response is Sent:

Ensure that no other response is sent after res.status(...).json(...).
